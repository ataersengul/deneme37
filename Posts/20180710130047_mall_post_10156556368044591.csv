,,,20180708212144,b'Jill Aebi-Mytton',b'BBC said the first four were the weakest as assessed by a doctor presumably because they would not survive much longer in the cave.',

,,,20180709011715,b'Philip Mar',b'The News here in Thailand is that 3 boys and the Coach came out yesterday... my Thai is not very good so it is from a translation....[Thai News on Thai TV Live]. appears that many News Agents report different things....',

,,,20180710101839,b'Ron Smith',"b'A lot of people are ""fingering"" the coach. As I understand he was a former Buddhist Monk. His understanding and application of meditation is being applauded as helping to save those young lives'",
,,,20180710102046,b'Marg Hoyle',b'Yes... and I hope they dont start blaming him. He kept the boys alive until they were found. They are bringing him out tonight also I think... and the medical guys who have been treating the boys while in the cave.',
,,,20180710102116,b'Marg Hoyle',b'11th out and confirmed :)',
,,,20180710103207,b'Marg Hoyle',"b'Hmmm interesting but understandable bit of news. Quote Kaho Sod English\'s source ""confirmed rumors that the children have been medically sedated, and reviving them fully is why it takes time for them to emerge from the cave entrance.""'",
,,,20180710103422,b'Ron Smith',b'The diving doctors. I am absolutely gobsmacked with those guys. No wonder the lead doctor was an aneasthetist',
,,,20180710103607,b'Marg Hoyle',b'Yes.. Hmmm I think they would have needed a hammer to sedate me enough to make that trip out of the caves.',
,,,20180710103936,b'Lucelle Oliver',b'That (sedation) actually makes sense if the kids were not strong swimmers. And having an anxious and panicky child would use much more oxygen than a sedated one.',
,,,20180710104505,b'Marg Hoyle',b'Yes... It makes heaps of sense.',
,,,20180710105603,b'Marg Hoyle',b'hmmm Im about to go to sleep in my chair :) Think I will leave my faith with the rescue guys..... go to bed and sleep with the radio on. :) Take care all. xoxo',

,,,20180710111735,b'Rod Wilkins',"b'That\xe2\x80\x99s lovely but can I ask why? Why did God let them go in there in the first place? Why did he let it rain and trap them? Do you think God doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care but will change his mind because you prayed? So many questions! Just asking for the sake of the young, you understand!'",
